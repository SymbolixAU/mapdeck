\arguments{
\item{map}{a mapdeck map object}

\item{data}{data to be used in the layer. All coordinates are expected to be in
Web Mercator Projection}

\item{layer_id}{single value specifying an id for the layer. Use this value to
distinguish between shape layers of the same type. Layers with the same id are likely
to conflict and not plot correctly}

\item{origin}{vector of longitude and latitude columns, or an \code{sfc} column}

\item{destination}{vector of longitude and latitude columns, or an \code{sfc} column}

\item{id}{an id value in \code{data} to identify layers when interacting in Shiny apps.}

\item{stroke_from}{variable or hex colour to use as the staring stroke colour}

\item{stroke_from_opacity}{Either a string specifying the
column of \code{data} containing the stroke opacity of each shape, or a value
between 1 and 255 to be applied to all the shapes}

\item{stroke_to}{variable or hex colour to use as the ending stroke colour}

\item{stroke_to_opacity}{Either a string specifying the
column of \code{data} containing the stroke opacity of each shape, or a value
between 1 and 255 to be applied to all the shapes}

\item{stroke_width}{width of the stroke in pixels}

\item{tilt}{value to tilt the arcs to the side, in degrees [-90, 90]}

\item{height}{value to multiply the height.}

\item{tooltip}{variable of \code{data} containing text or HTML to render as a tooltip}

\item{auto_highlight}{logical indicating if the shape under the mouse should auto-highlight}

\item{highlight_colour}{hex string colour to use for highlighting. Must contain the alpha component.}

\item{legend}{either a logical indiciating if the legend(s) should be displayed, or
a named list indicating which colour attributes should be included in the legend.}

\item{legend_options}{A list of options for controlling the legend.}

\item{legend_format}{A list containing functions to apply to legend values. See section legend}

\item{palette}{string or matrix. String will be one of \code{colourvalues::colour_palettes()}.
A matrix must have at least 5 rows, and 3 or 4 columns of values between [0, 255],
where the 4th column represents the alpha. You can use a named list to specify a different
palette for different colour options (where available),
 e.g. list(fill_colour = "viridis", stroke_colour = "inferno")}

\item{na_colour}{hex string colour to use for NA values}

\item{update_view}{logical indicating if the map should update the bounds to include this layer}

\item{focus_layer}{logical indicating if the map should update the bounds to only include this layer}

\item{transitions}{list specifying the duration of transitions.}

\item{brush_radius}{radius of the brush in metres. Default NULL. If supplied,
the arcs will only show if the origin or destination are within the radius of the mouse.
If NULL, all arcs are displayed}
}
\description{
The Arc Layer renders raised arcs joining pairs of source and target coordinates
}
\details{
\code{add_arc} supports POINT sf objects

MULTIPOINT objects will be treated as single points. That is, if an sf objet
has one row with a MULTIPOINT object consisting of two points, this will
be expanded to two rows of single POINTs.
Therefore, if the origin is a MULTIPOINT of two points, and the destination is
a single POINT, the code will error as there will be an uneven number of rows
}
\section{data}{


If \code{data} is a simple feature object, you need to supply the origin and destination
columns, they aren't automatically detected.
}

\section{id}{


The \code{id} is returned to your R session from an interactive shiny environment
by observing layer clicks. This is useful for returning the data.frame row relating to the
cliked shape.

From within a shiny server you would typically use \code{ observeEvent({input$map_arc_click})},
where 'map' is the map_id supplied to \code{mapdeckOutput()}, and 'arc' is the layer
you are clicking on
}

\section{legend}{


The \code{legend_options} can be used to control the appearance of the legend.
This should be a named list, where the names are one of
\itemize{
  \item{css - a string of valid \code{css} for controlling the appearance of the legend}
  \item{title - a string to use for the title of the legend}
}

If the layer allows different fill and stroke colours, you can use different options for each. See examples in \link{add_arc}.

The \code{legend_format} can be used to control the format of the values in the legend.
This should be a named list, where the names are one of
\itemize{
  \item{fill_colour}
  \item{stroke_colour}
}

depending on which type of colouring the layer supports.

The list elements must be functions to apply to the values in the legend.
}

\section{transitions}{


The transitions argument lets you specify the time it will take for the shapes to transition
from one state to the next. Only works in an interactive environment (Shiny)
and on WebGL-2 supported browsers and hardware.

The time is in milliseconds
