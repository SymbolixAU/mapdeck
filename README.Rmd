## What is mapdeck?

An R library which lets you plot interactive maps using Mapbox GL and Deck.gl

## What is mapbox?

> Mapbox is the location data platform for mobile and web applications. We provide building blocks to add location features like maps, search, and navigation into any experience you create.

- https://www.mapbox.com/about/

## What is deck.gl?

> deck.gl is a WebGL-powered framework for visual exploratory data analysis of large datasets.

- http://deck.gl/#/

## How do I use it? 

Everything you need to know to get you started is on the [home page](https://symbolixau.github.io/mapdeck/articles/mapdeck.html)

## Installation

#### From cran

```r
install.packages("mapdeck")
```

#### Development version


To use the development version you need some other development dependant libraries

```r
devtools::install_github("SymbolixAU/jsonify", force = TRUE)
devtools::install_github("dcooley/sfheaders", force = TRUE)
devtools::install_github("SymbolixAU/geojsonsf", force = TRUE)
devtools::install_github("SymbolixAU/colourvalues", force = TRUE)
devtools::install_github("SymbolixAU/spatialwidget", force = TRUE)
devtools::install_github("SymbolixAU/mapdeck")
```

## Getting Started

Mapdeck uses [Mapbox maps](https://www.mapbox.com/), and to use Mapbox you need an [access token](https://www.mapbox.com/help/how-access-tokens-work/).

Once you've generate a token you can use their maps.

Call `mapdeck(token = 'your_token')` to generate a basic map. Then start adding layers by using one of the various `add_*()` functions. 

```r
url <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/2011_february_aa_flight_paths.csv'
flights <- read.csv(url)
flights$info <- paste0("<b>",flights$airport1, " - ", flights$airport2, "</b>")

mapdeck(token = key, style = mapdeck_style('dark')) %>%
  add_arc(
    data = flights
    , origin = c("start_lon", "start_lat")
    , destination = c("end_lon", "end_lat")
    , stroke_from = "airport1"
    , stroke_to = "airport2"
    , tooltip = "info"
    , layer_id = 'arclayer'
  )
```

## Getting help

For general help and advice the best place to ask is on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mapdeck) (using the `mapdeck` tag).

If you've found a bug, or want a new feature added then use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/SymbolixAU/mapdeck/issues) on github.

I don't respond to emails asking for help because this is an open source package, and any advice should be kept open so everyone can benefit. (unless you want to pay me!)
